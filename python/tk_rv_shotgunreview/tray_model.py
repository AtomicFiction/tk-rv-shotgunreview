        Request that a thumbnail is downloaded for an item. If a thumbnail is successfully
        retrieved, either from disk (cached) or via shotgun, the method _populate_thumbnail()
        will be called. If you want to control exactly how your shotgun thumbnail is
        to appear in the UI, you can subclass this method. For example, you can subclass
        this method and perform image composition prior to the image being added to
        the item object.

        .. note:: This is an advanced method which you can use if you want to load thumbnail
            data other than the standard 'image' field. If that's what you need, simply make
            sure that you set the download_thumbs parameter to true when you create the model
            and standard thumbnails will be automatically downloaded. This method is either used
            for linked thumb fields or if you want to download thumbnails for external model data
            that doesn't come from Shotgun.

        :param item: :class:`~PySide.QtGui.QStandardItem` which belongs to this model
        :param field: Shotgun field where the thumbnail is stored. This is typically ``image`` but
                      can also for example be ``sg_sequence.Sequence.image``.
